  description: 'There exists a potion said to break the curse of petrification, restoring
    those turned to stone to their original form. The effects, however, are not guaranteed.
    Some have claimed to walk again, while others remain frozen, as if the curse
    resists. The brew is volatile, its true nature hidden in the shadows. Be warned:
    not all curses are meant to be undone.'
